## Setup

To install dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This command will start the server with Nodemon, which automatically restarts it when file changes are detected.

## Running Tests

### Unit Testing

To run tests using Jest:

```bash
yarn test
```

This will execute all the test cases located in the `tests/ut/` directory.

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Unit tests are automatically run in GitHub Actions CI pipeline

## API Testing

Running API Tests Locally:

1. Build and start the server:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   node dist/server.js
   ```

2. In another terminal, run the API tests:
   ```bash
   yarn test:api
   ```

**CI/CD Integration:**
- API tests are automatically run in GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- Tests run after unit tests and application build
- Newman results are uploaded as artifacts for review

## Linting

To check for linting issues using ESLint:

```bash
yarn lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues:

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

These commands help maintain code quality and consistency across the `src/` and `tests/ut/` directories.

## Formatting

To check if the code is properly formatted with Prettier:

```bash
yarn format:check
```

To automatically format the code:

```bash
yarn format
```

These commands ensure consistent code style in the `src/` and `tests/ut/` directories.

## Building the Application

To compile the TypeScript code:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate JavaScript files from the TypeScript source code.
